## Description

This workshop is designed to build foundational skills in R, covering everything from importing and cleaning data to transforming it for analysis. It also introduces essential statistical techniques used in environmental epidemiology, including `Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNM)`, `Cox regression`, `time series analysis`, and data visualization with `ggplot2`.

## Learning objectives

-   Understand what parameterized reporting is and when it is useful.
-   Convert a Quarto document into a parameterized template and render
    all variations.
-   Generate multiple format outputs from the same template using
    conditional content, conditional code execution, and custom styling.
